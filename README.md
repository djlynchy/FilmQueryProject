# lessons learned
while doing this project, i learned how the different java objects better relate with each other.

i also learned how online databases can be accessed through using java.

its important to remember to update your pom file. or nothing works right.

and becareful about throwing exceptions, it may not always work.

i would have to say the most import concept i learned during this exercise is to try to stay on course with the project. i found myself on many tangents and even fell down a rabbit hole or two while using Google.
